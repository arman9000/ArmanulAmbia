                        I have been an instructor at theCoderSchool since January 2019 and have felt personal growth through my time at the company. The company focuses on teaching code to students aged 7 to 17 in a fun, supportive, project-based approach. It instills the ideas that every student learns differently, and that <strong>everyone</strong> can benefit from learning the fundamentals of programming. I started as a very nervous code coach as a high school senior, and under the support and guidance of theCoderSchool team, I became an effective teacher in scratch, Java, C++, Python, HTML, and CSS. Over the last two years, I have worked as a one on one coach, two on one coach, class instructor, and a project lead for a STEM outreach program to local elementary and middle schools.

                        Boeing was my first industry-level internship and is where I realized my passion for computer science. This was a 150-hour summer internship that brought together high school students from across the state of California. The engineering practicum allowed us to work in teams of 4 or 5 assigned to mentors who were senior-level engineers at Boeing. The experience gave me invaluable exposure to all forms of engineering, including mechanical, electrical, chemical, systems, energy, and software. Additionally, I gained access to a network of like-minded and supportive prospective engineers and students.

                <p class="ptxt">
                    My running database is a project completed during my senior year of high school. The project was designed to help my cross country coach and address the issue of relaying race results to students. After every cross country meet my coach would have to go in and update the records of over sixty runners and print them out to deliver to the team the next practice. This process could take hours, and my coach would have to complete this every week during season. The project is coded as a GUI using java swing libraries and databases. It maintains text files with data for each runner that can be easily updated, saving time and limiting errors. This makes it so my coach can focus less on logistics and more on what he loves, running!

                    In the wake of Covid-19, many systemic changes took place in my University's Data Structures course. The final project for data structures was converted into an analysis of all the structures we covered in the course. This allowed me to dive into arrays, vectors, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and maps to analyze their efficiencies. The project compares the time complexity of each of these data structures in regards to operations such as adding to the front, adding to the back, removing from the front, removing from the back, removing from the front, and searching. It is completely coded using C++ standard libraries and includes a graphic report to display the results of the tests.

                <p class="ptxt"> 
                    Following my python course in the spring of 2020, I began experimenting with different modules and utilities offered by python. One of the most versatile and exciting to me was the pygame library. I began using pygame to create small shooter games and platformers, following online tutorials, and gaining insight into the holistic method of game design. After a month of work, I grasped many of the concepts, and was able to recreate one of my favorite childhood games, connect 4. I had created both tic tac toe and connect 4 in a console-based format before fully developing a GUI in pygame for the connect 4 project. This allows the user to place pieces and play red against black, replicating the classic game.

                        The President's scholarship program is the most prestigious scholarship offered by CSUF and recognizes leadership, service, and academics. This is a full-ride scholarship that brings together high school seniors who have displayed these qualities in diverse ways for a four-year program. By being a member of this scholarship group, I, along with 15 of my peers, contribute back to the CSU through several service activities and leadership roles. All members come from different educational backgrounds with different goals. Regardless, we all carry the spirit of the President's scholar program and are poised to contribute back to the CSU as well as our communities.

                        I serve as the vice president of the TEDxCSUF, a brand new branch of the global TEDx organization. We are dedicated to providing a platform for knowledge and growth that brings together speakers from all over. TEDxCSUF is an opportunity for me to learn from my peers as well as high-profile individuals, professionals, and professors. I personally believe in the value of quality education and love learning from others. Currently, we are planning our first large scale TEDxEvent for October 2021 and are inviting an exciting cast of unique speakers.

                    <p class = 'ptxt'>
                        Relay for Life is an organization that I was a part of in high school and founded at CSUF. This was the most transformative service experience I have ever had. It involves 24 hour events where volunteers gather to 
                        raise funds and give physical aids to cancer patients, survivors, and victims. While I have had the good fortune of never having cancer affect someone in my family, I have witnessed how destructive this terrible disease can be.
                        Attending Relay for Life events gave me a perspective I never had before and was something that I wanted to share with my peers. My involvement with different organizations on campus helped me start this program and prepare
                        for our first relay in 2021.
